## About Me

Hello! My name is Allen and I am a third year *Computer Engineering* major at UC San Diego. During my free time, I love to draw, paint, or play the piano. I also enjoy playing badminton or table tennis with my friends!

## Coursework

**CSE 101 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms:**
> Design and analysis of efficient algorithms with emphasis of nonnumerical algorithms such as sorting, searching, pattern matching, and graph and network algorithms. Measuring complexity of algorithms, time and storage. NP-complete problems.

**CSE 110 - Software Engineering:**
> Introduction to software development and engineering methods, including specification, design, implementation, testing, and process. An emphasis on team development, agile methods, and use of tools such as IDEâ€™s, version control, and test harnesses.

**CSE 140 - Components and Design Techniques for Digital Systems:**
> Design of Boolean logic and finite state machines; two-level, multilevel combinational logic design, combinational modules and modular networks, Mealy and Moore machines, analysis and synthesis of canonical forms, sequential modules.
